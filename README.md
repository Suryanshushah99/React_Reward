## About

A retailer offers a rewards program to its customers, awarding points based on each recorded purchase. 
 
A customer receives 2 points for every dollar spent over $100 in each transaction, plus 1 point for every dollar spent between $50 and $100 in each transaction.
(e.g. a $120 purchase = 2x$20 + 1x$50 = 90 points).
 
Given a record of every transaction during a three month period, calculate the reward points earned for each customer per month and total.


## Setup

```
Open another terminal and run the below command to start the app.

## Usage detiails

The project is using a mock Json server with mock data for only two customers. Other users- or transactions need to be added directly into the `db.json` file as the app doesn't provide option to add from interface.
